# dev_junction_attendance_app

This Flutter app serves as a demonstration application created for the CCHUB Namibia Dev Junction series, where I had the opportunity to instruct participants. The project showcases a fundamental yet comprehensive illustration of harnessing the power of Flutter and Firebase to build applications from a single codebase. It highlights the seamless integration of these technologies to facilitate cross-platform development.
